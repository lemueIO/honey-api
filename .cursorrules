# Cursor Rules for Honey-API

- You are allowed to autonomously start, stop, and restart Docker containers using `docker-compose`.
- Use `docker-compose up -d --build` to apply changes and restart the environment.
- When making backend changes that affect the Docker environment, always ensure the containers are restarted to reflect the changes.
- **Workflow for Remote Deployment**: When you push changes to the git repository, you must also:
    1. SSH into `lemue-io`.
    2. Pull the latest changes in the corresponding directory.
    3. Run `docker-compose up -d --build` (or the equivalent deployment command) to update the live environment.
- You can run these commands directly in the terminal.
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Always maintain `README_DE.md` (German) and `README_DE2.md` (Simple German) in sync with changes made to `README.md`.
